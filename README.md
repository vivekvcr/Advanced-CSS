# Advanced CSS Techniques Showcase

This project is a collection of HTML files demonstrating various advanced CSS techniques. It serves as a showcase and educational resource for understanding and implementing modern CSS features for web development.

## Project Structure

The project primarily consists of HTML files located in the `Week One` directory and a PDF document in the `Documents` directory.

### `Week One/`

This directory contains HTML files that showcase different CSS concepts:

*   **`Effects.html`**: Demonstrates a variety of visually appealing CSS effects, animations (transitions and transforms), and modern layout techniques including Flexbox and CSS Grid. It also includes examples of responsive design using media queries.
*   **`index.html` (Advanced CSS Animations Demo)**: Focuses on CSS transitions, transforms, and keyframe animations. It provides practical examples of bounce, pulse, rotate, and wave animations, along with demonstrations of timing functions and card hover effects. Performance optimization tips for animations are also included.
*   **`responsive-layout-demo.html` (Responsive Layout Demo - Flexbox & CSS Grid)**: Illustrates how to combine CSS Flexbox and Grid to create responsive and adaptive web layouts. It includes examples of a responsive navigation bar, hero section, feature cards, content-sidebar layout, and a gallery.
*   **`week-three.html` (Advanced CSS Media Queries Demo)**: Provides a comprehensive demonstration of advanced CSS media queries for responsive web design. It covers different breakpoints, adaptive navigation, responsive typography, an image gallery that adjusts to screen size, and advanced media query features like orientation detection, high DPI display support, and user preference queries (e.g., dark mode, reduced motion).

### `Documents/`

This directory contains:

*   **`Advanced CSS Animations Presentation Guide.pdf`**: A PDF document that likely serves as a guide or script for a presentation on advanced CSS animations, presumably using the HTML files in this project as visual aids.

## How to Use

To view the demonstrations, simply open any of the HTML files located in the `Week One/` directory in a modern web browser.
